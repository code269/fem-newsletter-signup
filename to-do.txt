General:
    - Check if success and fail still working as intended
    - Cleanup code, got pretty messy with this feat

Desktop:
    - Flex order is reversed (Done)
    - Fix spacing of everything
        - Start with setting a max-width (Done)
    - Setting the container width to 900px and img to 50%
        - Works for that specific 900px width, but breaks otherwise

Current:

        - Illus looks out of place, borders unruly

    - Look into git alias
    - Grid to align the bullet/checkpoints
