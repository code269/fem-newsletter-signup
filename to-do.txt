General:
    - Style tablet view
    - Style desktop view

    - ? How should I include the success message?
        - Seems like it wants me to keep as single page app
        - ? Can I use it as a "before/after" psuedoclass?
        - ? Should I just have the original stuff hidden and the success messsage visible after validation?

    - Do I need the 'block' class? Is it better to just select and add?

Tablet:
    - Design assets has a tablet mode, so will include tablet mode

Desktop:
    - Flex order is reversed

Current:
    - Style mobile success page
